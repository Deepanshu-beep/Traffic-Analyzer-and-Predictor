# Traffic-Analyzer-and-Predictor
Here's the Notebook in which you can find the code for Traffic Analyzer and Predictor

This Model has been implemented using YOLO Algorithm.

Currently I'm extracting Bicycles, Bikes, Cars, Buses and Pedestrians from the Input. You may extract other features as well which are mentioned in coco.names of YOLO such as Trucks, Trains, etc.
